2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell idecode_0/ASel_tmp_reg[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) control_0/ASel_tmp_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell idecode_0/BSel_tmp_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) control_0/BSel_tmp_reg/CLR, control_0/BSel_tmp_reg_rep/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell idecode_0/EXTOp_tmp_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) control_0/EXTOp_tmp_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ifetc_0/ir_0/Itype_temp_reg[4]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) idecode_0/Itype_temp_reg[0]/CLR, idecode_0/Itype_temp_reg[1]/CLR, idecode_0/Itype_temp_reg[2]/CLR, idecode_0/Itype_temp_reg[3]/PRE, idecode_0/Itype_temp_reg[4]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT DO_temp_reg[31]_i_5 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.
